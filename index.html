        <p>You’re not alone.</p>

        <p>Imagine how it would feel if you could make CSS do what you want without the pain:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>You could approach CSS with confidence instead of with a sense of dread.</p></li>
          <li><p>You could fix visual bugs uncovered by your product manager in record time, allowing you to go home early and avoid spending all evening trying to get that text to stop overflowing, damnit.</p></li>
          <li><p>The next time your company proposes a redesign, you could volunteer to take the lead on the project, allowing you to stand out from your colleagues and win over your boss (this was the exact tactic I used to get a promotion at my last employer)</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Painless CSS</em> will give you the tools to master CSS and write it with confidence.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">It’s not your fault if you haven’t yet learned the easy way to write CSS</h3>

        <p>They never told you in your university CS classes (or at your bootcamp course) how important CSS is when you start working at a real job delivering real products. As a result, you’re pressured to ship CSS at your work where you don’t have time to learn the fundamentals.</p>

        <p>Worse, the existing CSS resources out there are very technical and assume you already know how browser C++ rendering engines work, which is not at all approachable.</p>

        <p>Because there is no good resource that gives you a solid mental model for how CSS actually works from the ground up, you’re left copy/pasting stuff from Stack Overflow and hoping it works. No wonder it feels so painful to debug those exotic display issues.</p>

        <p><em>Painless CSS</em> is the well-explained, no-nonsense resource that you've been waiting for that gives you the real skills you need to write professional-grade CSS.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center">After the course, writing CSS will feel like this:</h3>

        <p>CSS is a hidden skill that separates the best software engineers from average ones. This is because using CSS to build user interfaces helps you learn the skills needed to work directly with users and understand their needs.</p>

        <p>The engineering recruiting company Triplebyte <a href="https://triplebyte.com/blog/who-y-combinator-companies-want" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="rainbow-text">analyzed</a> what types of engineers get hired at Y&nbsp;Combinator companies. Their conclusion is clear: “Product Programmers”, those who are motivated by product design, get hired much more often than everyone else.</p>

        <p><img src="images/product-programmers-annotated.png" alt="A table that shows the majority of companies saying they are more 'interested' in a 'Product Programmer' profile than all other profiles such as 'Technical Programmer' and 'Enterprise Programmer'" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" /></p>

        <p>Top companies desperately want more “Product Programmers” because they have the skills to see things from a user's perspective.</p>

        <p>Engineering managers love developers who understand users. Working on web design with CSS is the best way to get into the user's head and earn yourself a raise.</p>

        <p>There are so few people who are true CSS experts, that it's the easiest way to get an edge over your co-workers, especially if you are a recent grad. This was exactly what I did at my first job out of school&mdash;by solving tough CSS problems from day one, I convinced management to assign me to the most rewarding and impactful front-end projects, allowing me to get promoted to a senior position in just over a year, despite lacking the traditional pedigree.</p>


        <p><em>Painless CSS</em> starts from first principles and gives you the confidence to solve web design problems on your own without having to resort to brute trial and error.</p>

    <section class="row mb-5">
      <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 offset-sm-0">
        <h2 id="non-technical" class="text-center">What if I’m not a programmer?</h2>

        <p>Programmers are not the only folks who benefit from a strong understanding of CSS; here are some things you can accomplish after taking the course if you work in a non-technical role:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Designers</strong> can build their own rapid prototypes for higher quality user feedback, and communicate easier with developers by speaking the same vocabulary.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Growth Hackers and Marketers</strong> can do their own design tweaking and A/B testing to move faster. No more filing tickets on Jira and waiting 3 months for a response from engineering, while your competitor has already launched a new campaign.</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Product Managers</strong> can get a stronger sense of the timelines and resources required for each feature. You'll be able to negotiate more effectively for a budget when you understand why your developers gave the time estimate they did.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>While this course is supposedly about learning CSS, it’s really a course about how to develop the strong internal skills required to master any technical subject. You'll benefit from this course if you have any of the following goals:</p>

        <ul class="icon-list card card-body list-unstyled">
          <li class="media">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb icon-bullet"></i>
            <div class="media-body">
              <p>You are an absolute beginner and want to learn CSS from scratch.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="media">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb icon-bullet"></i>
            <div class="media-body">
              <p>You already know CSS and want to fill in the holes in your knowledge, or strengthen your mental models for how CSS works behind the scenes.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="media">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb icon-bullet"></i>
            <div class="media-body">
              <p>You've been working with CSS for some time, but never really “got it”.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li class="media">
            <i class="fas fa-lightbulb icon-bullet"></i>
            <div class="media-body">
              <p>You are non-technical, and want a better understanding of the technologies that your colleagues work with, so you can make better decisions when web design is involved.</p>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some examples:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>You are a <strong>student</strong> who wants to learn CSS to get your first job as a designer or a front-end developer.</p></li>
          <li><p>You are a <strong>programmer who graduated from a coding bootcamp</strong>, but are now finding that you need to work with CSS a lot in your job and your bootcamp didn’t teach you anything about CSS.</p></li>
          <li><p>You are an <strong>experienced back-end developer</strong> who wants to work on the front-end, but want to learn quickly using a resource that doesn't waste months of your time.</p></li>
          <li><p>You are a <strong>designer who wants to learn more about the underlying web technologies</strong> to improve your design specs and reduce the chance of them coming back with tons of corrections.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Even if you don't fit into any of the profiles above</strong>, you’ll find the mental models taught by this course useful for mastering a variety of technical subjects, such as: learning astrophysics, breaking into quantitative finance, building a bicycle, or just succeeding in the tech industry in general. This is because all technical subjects benefit from the principle of decomposing a topic into its constituent parts and then developing good intuitions for how these parts congeal to form a coherent whole. <em>Painless CSS</em> will show you how to do this.</p>

        <p>Other programming video courses of this calibre cost $300 to $700, and many don't include interactive homework exercises to strengthen your skills, nor do they include a comprehensive reference guide that continues to be useful after you've taken the course. <em>Painless CSS</em> is not simply a video course you just take once and then forget about the moment you're done. You'll find yourself referring back to the <em>Five Steps to Painless CSS</em> throughout your career to solve a wide variety of technical problems.</p>

        <p>While I could easily charge the same $300 to $700 for a video course like this, <em>Painless CSS</em> can be yours for only <span class="sale-strike">$180</span>(<span class="badge badge-primary">NEW!</span> Preorder sale: $89) because I've gotten to a point in my career where I am tired of broken, frustrating codebases and I am more interested in giving back and helping the next generation of programmers find joy in working with CSS and avoid the same problems that have plagued other front-end developers for decades.</p>

        <p>I've seen friends graduate from their expensive $12,000 coding bootcamps that only taught one class on CSS, and never anything beyond the basics. <em>Painless CSS</em> is not only the most complete guide to CSS out there, it also helps you become a better front-end developer by teaching you how to write clean, maintainable code that your co-workers will adore.</p>

        <p>Many people start learning programming only to quit or burn out because they are too frustrated by the bugs that are hard to understand and take hours to fix. Don't quit on your dream of learning how to code&mdash;<em>Painless CSS</em> will give you a framework for quickly solving these bugs. Chapter&nbsp;2 provides a structured method for sustaining your momentum when your motivation for learning inevitably decreases over time.</p>

        <p>The <em>Five Steps to Painless CSS</em> is a step-by-step checklist you can follow to fix any visual bug you encounter; even the weird, confusing ones. Just this one chapter alone will pay for itself the next time you avoid having to waste your entire day on a stupid CSS bug that seemingly just refuses to go away.</p>

        <h2 id="faq" class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt><p>There are lots of free resources already, why should I buy this course?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Free online CSS tutorials are not organized or curated in any way. I've seen too many people waste <em>days</em> or even <em>months</em> of their time trying to piece together their CSS knowledge based on free tutorials. Free resources help get you the answer once or twice, and can help you in a pinch, but they don't help you build a solid foundation for actually <em>understanding</em> CSS beyond specific hacks that break too easily. Time is money after all, and buying a well-designed course can save you months of wasted effort.</p>
          <p>In fact, the main reason I created this course in the first place was because many of my friends were extremely frustrated by the free tutorials out there, and the lack of a good, comprehensive course that teaches you foundational principles instead of quick and dirty tricks.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>I'm not ready to buy right now. Do you have other options?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>I understand if you are hesitant to buy right away&mdash;if you <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="rainbow-text" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#emailSignupModal">sign up</a> for the email list you can get 3 free sample lessons to see if the content is right for you.</p>
          <p>Note that this is the best time to lock in the current price because right now I am doing a preorder sale for the video course, and once it's released I will be raising the price soon.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>I'm not a software developer. Should I read this book?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>While this book is supposedly about learning CSS, it’s really a book about how to develop the strong internal skills required to master any technical subject. You'll benefit from this course if you have any of the goals <a href="#non-technical" class="rainbow-text">listed here</a>.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>What do you teach in the video course that is not taught in the book?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Not all of the book's homework exercises have solutions, but the video course provides a complete guided walkthrough of every exercise, including the ones where the book merely provides an answer and not an explanation.</p>
          <p>Science shows there is a phenomenon of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxi6siZeF6w&t=4m27s" class="rainbow-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illusory learning</a>, where you feel like you are learning something but are not actually retaining it. To avoid this, you need to compare your practice exercises to an objective standard. The best resource for this is in the video course where I explain each answer fully so you can gain a complete understanding of <em>why</em> I arrived at each solution, instead of just getting the right answer and moving on.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>What formats are the book available in?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>If you purchase the book on Gumroad, it is available in <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.epub</code>, <code>.mobi</code>, and <code>.azw3</code> (Amazon Kindle) formats. All DRM-free.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>Can I get a physical copy of the book?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Yes, you can purchase the paperback version <a href="https://amzn.to/2GljeLL" class="rainbow-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Amazon</a>. If you have a Kindle, you can also purchase the Kindle DRM-locked ebook on Amazon. The pricing options above don't include the physical book because this is an optional add-on, and I'm including this for completeness to satisfy the folks who <em>really</em> want a physical book and not an ebook.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>What will I learn in the sample lessons?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>The sample lessons cover <em>Lesson 1: HTML</em>, <em>Lesson 3: Rendering</em>, and <em>Lesson 6: Parsing</em>. <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="rainbow-text" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#emailSignupModal">Click&nbsp;here</a> to get the sample lessons.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>Do you give volume discounts?</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Yes. If you'd like to purchase multiple courses for your team, click on the “<a href="https://gum.co/painless-css-video-team/preorder-sale-video-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="rainbow-text">Buy for your Team</a>” button above.</p></dd>

          <dt><p>I have a question not covered here.</p></dt>
          <dd><p>Sure! Ask me via email: <a aria-label="bill@jellyfish Replace the word 'jellyfish' with 'billmei.net'" class="emailLink emailLinkDirection rainbow-text">ten.iemllib@llib</a></p></dd>

        <p>Hey, I'm <a href="https://billmei.net" class="rainbow-text">Bill Mei</a>. For years, I've been consulting for software startups to help them ship beautiful web design. But I got tired of seeing people make the same mistakes with CSS and then giving up after all the existing free online tutorials failed them.</p>

        <p>I created this course to share with you my secrets for writing maintainable, easy-to-understand CSS that is a joy to work with—<strong>secrets that my clients normally pay hundreds of dollars an hour for</strong>! But I am tired of broken, ulcer-inducing code popping up everywhere and I am sharing these secrets with you because I want CSS to finally shed its undeserved reputation and rise from the ashes as the beautiful programming language that it is. <em>Painless CSS</em> is the well-explained, no-nonsense resource that you've been waiting for that will help you see this too.</p>
